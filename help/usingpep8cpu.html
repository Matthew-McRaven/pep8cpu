 This CPU simulator is an implementation of the data section of the Pep/8 CPU as shown in Figure 12.2 of the textbook
 <i>Computer Systems</i>, J. Stanley Warford, Fourth edition, Jones and Bartlett, Publishers, 2010.
 <p>
 The simulator has two modes of operation &mdash; interactive and microcode.
 The application starts up in the interactive mode, which you can see by the fact that the two buttons "Clock" and
 "Copy to Microcode" are enabled and the two buttons "Single Step" and "Resume" are disabled.
 <p>

 <p>
 You switch from interactive to microcode mode by entering a microcode program in the Microcode pane and selecting
System->Start Debugging from the menu or clicking the corresponding Start Debugging icon on the toolbar.

When you are in microcode mode, the two buttons "Clock" and "Copy to Microcode" are disabled and the
two buttons "Single Step" and "Resume" are enabled.

You exit the microcode mode in one of two ways &mdash; by running a microcode sequence to completion
or by selecting System->Stop Debugging from the menu or clicking the corresponding Stop Debugging icon on the toolbar.
