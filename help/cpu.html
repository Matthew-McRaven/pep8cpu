 This CPU simulator is an implementation of the data section of the Pep/8 CPU as shown in Figure 12.2 of the textbook
 <i>Computer Systems</i>, J. Stanley Warford, Fourth edition, Jones and Bartlett, Publishers, 2010.
 <p>
 The simulator has two modes of operation &mdash; interactive and microcode.
 This help page describes the interactive mode of operation.
 See the Microcode help page for instructions on the microcode mode of operation.
 <p>
  <p>
   Reference: <i>Computer Systems</i>, Chapter 12, Section 12.1.
  <p>
  With the interactive mode, the user sets the control signals individually for a single cycle.
  There are six kinds of control signals &mdash; register address signals, multiplexer signals,
  ALU function signals, the ANDZ signal, the memory read/write signals, and the clock signals.
  <p>
 <h3>Register address signals</h3>
There are three register address signals &mdash; A, B, and C.
Each signal is five bits and accesses one of the 32 one-byte registers in the two-port register bank.
To set a register address signal, enter a decimal integer value in the range 0..31.
<p>
 For example, the following figure shows a register address of 7 for A, 23 for B, and 7 for C.
 Address 7 is the least significant byte of the program counter, and address 23 is the ROM value of 1.
