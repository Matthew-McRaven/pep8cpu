Reference: <i>Computer Systems</i>, Chapter 12, Section 12.1.
<p>
With the interactive mode, the user controls the execution of a single CPU cycle.
The general process is to make the following settings:
<p>
1. <a href="#Memory">Initialize the memory values</a>
<p>
2. <a href="#Register">Initialize the register values</a>
<p>
3. <a href="#Control">Set the control signals</a>
<p>
4. <a href="#Clock">Enable the clock signals</a>
<p>
After making these settings, you can click the Clock button at the bottom of the CPU panel to see the effect of the cycle
on the state of the CPU.
If you are satisfied with the effect of the cycle, you may click the Copy to Microcode button, which
will insert a line of microcode text in the microcode panel at the position of the text cursor.

<h3><a name="Memory">1. Initialize the memory values</a></h3>
<h3><a name="Register">2. Initialize the register values</a></h3>
<h3><a name="Control">3. Set the control signals</a></h3>
Each control signal is activated by a GUI widget on the right side of the CPU panel.
<p>
There are five kinds of control signals &mdash; register address signals, multiplexer signals,
the ALU function signal, the ANDZ signal, and the memory read/write signals.
<p>
<h4>Register address signals</h4>
There are three register address signals &mdash; A, B, and C.
Each signal is five bits and accesses one of the 32 one-byte registers in the two-port register bank.
To set a register address signal, enter a decimal integer value in the range 0..31.
<p>
For example, the following figure shows a register address of 7 for A, 23 for B, and 7 for C.
Address 7 is the least significant byte of the program counter, and address 23 is the least
significant of ROM register M1, which has a value of 1.

<p>
 <h4>Multiplexer signals</h4>
 There are three multiplexer signals &mdash; AMux, MDRMux, and CMux.
 Each multiplexer control signal determines whether the output comes from the left input or the right input.
 A zero on a multiplexer control line sends the left input to the output, and a one sends the right input to the output.
 You set the control signal by clicking on the control signal box.
 Each click cycles through (1) zero, (2) one, and (3) no input, in sequence.
 <p>
 For example, the following figure shows the AMux control signal set to zero, which selects the left (yellow) input,
 and the CMux control signal set to one, which selects the right (blue) input.
 <p>
 <i>Figure with AMux=0, CMux=1, ALU=0</i>
 <p>
 <h4>The ALU function signal</h4>
 The ALU function signal is a single four-bit value that you enter as a decimal number.

  <p>
  <h4>The ANDZ signal</h4>
  <p>
  <h4>The memory read/write signals</h4>
  <p>
