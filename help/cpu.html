  With the interactive mode, the user sets the control signals individually for a single cycle.
  There are six kinds of control signals &mdash; register address signals, multiplexer signals,
  the ALU function signal, the ANDZ signal, the memory read/write signals, and the clock signals.
  <p>
 <h3>Register address signals</h3>
There are three register address signals &mdash; A, B, and C.
Each signal is five bits and accesses one of the 32 one-byte registers in the two-port register bank.
To set a register address signal, enter a decimal integer value in the range 0..31.
<p>
 For example, the following figure shows a register address of 7 for A, 23 for B, and 7 for C.
 Address 7 is the least significant byte of the program counter, and address 23 is the ROM value of 1.

 <p>

 <h3>Multiplexer signals</h3>
 There are three multiplexer signals &mdash; AMux, MDRMux, and CMux.
 Each multiplexer control signal determines whether the output comes from the left input or the right input.
 A zero on a multiplexer control line sends the left input to the output, and a one sends the right input to the output.
 You set the control signal by clicking on the control signal box.
 Each click cycles through (1) zero, (2) one, and (3) no input, in sequence.
 <p>
 For example, the following figure shows the AMux control signal set to zero, which selects the left (yellow) input,
 and the CMux control signal set to one, which selects the right (blue) input.
 <p>

  <p>
 <h3>The ALU function signal</h3>
 The ALU function signal is a single four-bit value that you enter as a decimal number.

  <p>
 <h3>The ANDZ signal</h3>
  <p>
 <h3>The memory read/write signals</h3>
  <p>
 <h3>The clock signals</h3>
